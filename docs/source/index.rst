=============================================


Thank you for choosing our Pan-tilt HAT.

Pan-Tilt HAT is a 2-axis Pan-Tilt kit for intelligent detection and free movement based on the Raspberry Pi. Built in a 5 megapixel camera and the Raspberry Pi extension board with 14 external interfaces, Pan-Tilt HAT can realize functions such as color detection, face detection, gesture detection and traffic sign detection, and can freely control the camera's turning around.
The free turning of the Pan-Tilt is mainly realized by two servos. The movable angle ranges 0~180° from left to right, and 0~90° from up to down.
Pan-Tilt HAT has 14 external interfaces, including 4 Analog ports, 4 PWM ports, 4 Digital ports, 2 I2C ports, etc.

This document includes the list and assembly pdf and programming.

The programming part is divided into two chapters: :ref:`Play with Ezblock` & :ref:`Play with Python`, each chapter allows you to explain how to make Pan-tilt HAT work the way you want.

Ezblock Studio is a development platform developed by SunFounder for beginners, aiming to lower the barriers to entry for Raspberry Pi. It has two programming languages: Graphical and Python, which can be used on almost all different types of devices. With Bluetooth and Wi-Fi support, you can download codes on Ezblock Studio and remotely control Raspberry Pi.

More experienced makers can use the popular programming language-Python.
