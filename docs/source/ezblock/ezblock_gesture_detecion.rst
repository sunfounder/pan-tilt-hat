**TIPS**


You may want to simplify your program with Variable. For example, when you need to use the values of the type of gesture repeatedly, just assign them to variables for repeated use instead of reading repeatedly.

Click the Create variable button on the Variables category to create a new variable.

You can read the results of the detected gesture through this block. In the drop-down menu, choose to read the coordinates, size, type or accuracy of the detected gesture.
