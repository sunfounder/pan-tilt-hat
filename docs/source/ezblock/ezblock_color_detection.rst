Drag the joystick to the center area. When using it, drag the white point in it to generate coordinates (-100~100).

This block reads the Joystick value in the Bluetooth control page. You can click the drop-down menu to switch to the Y-axis reading.

The map block can remap a number from one range to another. If a number is 50ï¼Œit is at 50% position of the range of 0~100; then if we map it to the range 0~255 via the map block, the number will be 127.5.
